## Description

Using React, I created a personal devloper portfolio that acts to showcases my best work, as I continue to develop my coding skills overtime. Being a web developer means being part of a community, and so it is essential to have a place to share my projects while applying for jobs or simply to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects.
